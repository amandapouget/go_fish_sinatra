refactor client class + spec
refactor server class + spec
run command line, browser game and see if working, create "wanted to features list"
Ask Roy about how to get the image files on the client side without shipping them over
Fix the icons thing (pull out to front end)

yank out the "current_match" stuff for simultaneous games

-[ ] Examine whether Player really has to have a name that comes from the user
-[ ] Think about putting contemplate_before in a more generic place

remove all jQuery
auto-update test database
make a player be able to leave the game and be replaced by robot (with timeout)

ROUTES in Rails
config/routes.rb some set of requests (route them to a specific controller)
RESTful interfaces (REpresentational State Transfer)
look at the Rails Guide to Controllers
your app.rb will be turned into a controller and you'll have a config/routes.rb, might have multiple controllers

TASK PRIORITIES
upgrade to Rails
make user_history/view_user/create_user pages, just needs to have an identifier (not username/password), "rankings" page [see slack directions]

IN TWO WEEKS YOU NEED TO HAVE THE BASICS OF RAILS DOWN

robots: move call to play to notify_observers, take out 'save' from match run play method
helpers:
-- make into two files
-- use common steps not just methods as much as possible in these files
  template method:
  -- all it does is call other methods
  -- if you start doing that, finish it (eg, game with three players each has one ace, then the last two lines of those methods should be extracted out into their own method (have_ace) )
-- change card_as to card_a_s and make it uniform to the file names
-- modify tests where all the players have the same card to have different suited cards using factory sequence ("if you give it the suit, it determines the suit, otherwise it sequences through the suits and picks one")
-- refactor the method beginning on line 48

rip out the @user_id from player (possibly change to just id)
-- help: only test if your UI reflects the state of the game "It's Fred turn"
